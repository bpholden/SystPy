README -- SystPy Systemic Python Bindings

Dependencies:

numpy
matplotlib ( For tutorial files only, not the main SystPy module )

Tutorial:
GL876_Fit.py - General outline for fitting a planetary system
GL876_Integration.py - General outline for preforming orbital integrations
GL876_Bootstrap.py - Generating error estimates for a planetary fit

These files assume access to SystPy.py, this is most easily accomplished by add the directory containing SystPy to your pythonpath, but you can also copy the SystPy files (defs.py, constants.py, SystPy.py) to the tutorials folder.
